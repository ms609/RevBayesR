\title{Launch and operate a RevBayes session}
\usage{
rbSession(
  args = character(),
  rb_path = Sys.getenv("rb.exe"),
  timeout = if (length(args) > 0) 2 else 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{args}{Arguments to pass to \code{rb.exe}.}

\item{rb_path}{Path to RevBayes executable. Defaults to \code{Sys.getenv("rb.exe")}.
Set this default value with \code{file.edit("~/.Renviron")} and adding a line
\code{rb.exe=path/to/rb.exe}.}

\item{timeout}{Time in seconds to wait for new lines to appear before
returning control to the R session.}
}
\value{
\code{rbSession()} returns a list with methods:
\itemize{
\item \code{do(cmd, wait = 0.1, echo = TRUE, timeout = 2)}: execute \code{cmd}, returning
control to the R terminal after no new output has been received for \code{wait}
seconds, or no output at all has been received for \code{timeout} seconds.
if \code{echo = TRUE}, output will be returned to the R console.
\item \code{history()}: Returns a character vector chronicling the input and output
sent and received by the session.
\item \code{input()}, \code{output()}: Return a character vector listing the input lines
and output lines sent and received by the session, respectively.
\item \code{flush()}: Display any output produced since the last command was submitted.
\item \code{interact()}: control the session interactively.
A blank line will return control to the R console, without terminating the
RevBayes session.
\item \code{quit()}: terminate the session
}
